  "blog2Subtext1": "Unfortunately, Instagram's rules often change, and the list of prohibited actions grows longer with each update. However, it's worth noting that following serious and fundamental mistakes, a permanent ban can follow. Every blogger should be aware of them. Here they are:\n- Persistent complaints and commenting on spam and posts\n- Displaying many marks on publications or stories\n- Sending direct messages similar to spam\n- Copyright infringement, such as using other people's photos, videos, music, etc., without permission\n- Creating additional profiles identical to the primary one. If one gets blocked, they can block all similar profiles.\n- Exposing erotic content, including images/videos of nudity, even children\n- Promoting eating disorders or suicide. Complaints may lead to blocking if the account encourages users to attempt digestive disorders or end their lives based on the account's information.\n- Pages containing negative, hateful, aggressive content, or signs of intolerance\n- Selling illegal products: weapons, drugs\n- Using logos of famous brands in content. Instagram quickly blocks accounts with photos containing the Instagram logo.\n- Collaborating with external services for fraud, boosting subscribers, likes, views, comments\n- Approving subscribers who often exceed subscription limits.

This can happen if one account is used from different cities or devices.\n- Providing any information about texts, photos, videos, contact data, accounts, cards, wallets, passport data, ID documents, etc.\n- Using external services for likes, subscribers, views, comments\n- Hosting public drawings and giving away prizes or cash.",
  "blog2Subtitle2": "What Does Temporary Blocking Mean?",
  "blog2Subtext2": "For most violations, Instagram often disables certain account features. For example, in cases of excessive commenting, the administrator may temporarily block this feature. Instagram can impose such blocks for several hours, sometimes even days.\nIf this happens, it's not advisable to react aggressively or write to technical support, attempting to perform the same actions persistently. Also, it's not advisable to use this feature once it's unlocked. Otherwise, Instagram may consider it a violation again, leading to more serious penalties.\nAdministrators often reset account passwords to avoid page hacking. They send letters with instructions to the user's email, informing about temporary blocking and violation. Passwords are restored through the link provided in the email.\nOnce three temporary locks occur, Instagram may permanently ban the account. This is considered disobedience to the rules, ignoring penalties.",
  "blog2Subtitle3": "Actions After Permanent Blocking",
  "blog2Subtext3": "When a profile accumulates a certain number of violations, Instagram deletes it without further ado. There's a possibility to recover its accessibility, but it's called permanent ban. What do they mainly do? In such a case? What actions should be taken, and is it worth restoring the page?\nThe most common approach is to claim that the account has been compromised. Even if it hasn't, claiming that the account has been compromised is the truth. Also, profile unlocking attempts can only be made through the official Instagram app. In your.

However, it's important to remember that not everyone benefits from it, and it doesn't work in all cases. Therefore, it's not necessary to rely on it.\nThe algorithm itself is as follows:\n- Open the official social networking app on your smartphone or mobile device.\n- Find the \"Login Help\" button. It's right below the \"Login\" button.\n- Follow all the instructions on the screen.\n- Fill out the form with the owner's identity information and the email provided.\n- A letter with additional instructions should arrive at the specified email. It's rare. Therefore, such emails should also be checked in the spam folder.\nTo unlock the account, Instagram may request several unreleased photos from the page. In the app, they may also request personal photos of the person. Some bloggers who have lost access to their accounts turn to unblocking experts. In most cases, experts help restore the account.\nIt's important not to violate the rules of social networks. Therefore, it's not risky. Not everyone who has been blocked succeeds in accessing restoration. Not even a hundred percent. Therefore, risking without ways to cope with this issue is meaningless.",

Typically, stores and other commercial accounts have these goals. Such blogs sell something and don't hide the price.\nAttracting potential customers. Blogs are created to attract the interest of a specific target audience, some of whom may become customers in the future. That is, the main mission is not sales but attraction.\nGaining popularity. The main purpose of the account is to make the brand or personality recognizable and popular. And a content plan for promoting personal branding is created.\nInteraction with customers. In this case, there are no sales. It's just communication with followers who may become the company's customers in the future.\nA content plan itself does not secure followers or make the account more popular. Its main purpose is to facilitate the operation process of the account.",
  "blog5Subtext2": "The first thing to do is to choose a program and device for convenient use of the content plan. Many people like to plan in tabular form.\nWhat should necessarily be in the table?\n- Dates (day, month, year);\n- Times of article publication (sometimes only morning, noon, evening may be specified)\n- Type of content (fun, informative, pre-sale, sales)\nAfter applying these principles, start writing the content plan. If you already have stories to post, you can save them in a separate folder in the cloud storage or in Instagram's temporary stories.",
  "blog5Subtext3": "The content plan should effectively influence follower engagement. Therefore, it is important to analyze all stories for future corrections. For this purpose, there are special metrics.\nMetrics allow evaluating the stories posted according to the content plan and comparing the set tasks with the implementation of these tasks in the app form.\nThe role of metrics:\n- Shows the reach and views of stories. It is important to monitor how many people watched the stories overall. These metrics affect advertising costs. The more accounts reached, the higher the cost of placing the story in advertising models. Moreover, organizing marathons has become popular now. Bloggers participate as speakers and pay for participation. And participation costs directly depend on the reach.\n- Tracks \"forward\" or \"backward\" actions. In this case, you can see which stories followers were most interested in. If there was a game, you can easily see what questions/tasks people found challenging.\n- Get out of stories. This metric is very uncomfortable for bloggers. It needs to be monitored during advertising placement. This allows you to check if the advertisement was useful and suitable for the target customer.\n- Subscriber reaction to stories. It is important to monitor interaction between followers and bloggers and stories. These metrics will increase with the appearance of response stickers or polls.",
  "blog5Subtext4": "What should be placed in the content plan's columns? It's best to describe in detail each story and each action. Examples include:\nMonday - Show products on sale, and inform about available and orderable items.\nTuesday - Explain what to look for when choosing products in this store.\nWednesday - Describe current special events.\nThursday - Tell stories about the appearance of the product.\nThis content plan is too simple. You can write one story every day. For example, in the morning, you can wish followers a good start to the day. An hour later, you can tell them how your day is going and what the blogger had for breakfast. In the afternoon, you can post an advertisement, and in the evening, you can create a quiz.\nThe more detailed the plan, the easier it is to post on Instagram. It also makes the analysis process easier.\nUnderstanding that no matter how good the story is, you should not be happy just because it exists. It's important to regularly monitor how subscribers react to the content, what interests they have.

  "blog6Subtitle2": "How Competitors Promote Their Accounts",
  "blog6Subtext1": "The most effective recent search feature on Instagram is provided by the app itself. Simply enter keywords in the search bar of the account's topic area, and the social network will automatically display a list of the most popular accounts.\nThe first analysis is sufficient with this list of competitors. The more popular the account, the more complex it becomes to analyze and search competitors.\nAfter completing the first step (searching for and selecting competitor pages needed for analysis), you can proceed to the second step. Typically, the second step involves the analysis process and is divided into multiple directions, each requiring thorough work.\nIt's best to start the analysis from the content. It's easier to make conscious decisions about the visual elements of the account.\nPoints to note when analyzing content:\n- General visual data of the profile page. In this case, pay attention to the profile's biography and design to get interesting \"features.\" More than 40% of potential customers are interested in the profile introduction. Typically, evaluate visual content. Check if there is a specific color scheme, if the main colors of stories, posts, highlights, and avatars match.\n- Content of profile posts. Examine several posts carefully to explore the topics. You may also get some ideas from the content. For example, look at what the competitors have been doing over the past 2-3 months. And get some ideas from these posts.\n- Ways in which interaction with followers is conducted. You can easily see how efficiently competitors communicate with customers. Writing on profile from fake accounts and evaluating service levels is enough. Customers appreciate quick resolution of issues and questions.\n- Engagement of target customers. Analyze how far competitors go to attract subscribers to their accounts. How? Monitor all content to see if surveys, quizzes, and games are being used, and if there is activity in posts and stories. You can borrow some ideas from activities, but be careful as not all ideas may be suitable. You can also borrow ideas from competitions and prizes from competitors. The most effective way to attract subscribers: People repost the account's posts/stories on their page, tag friends in the comments below the post, and select winners using the random extraction function in the contest profile the next day. What do subscribers want? Of course, there's prize money too. So, it must be relevant, popular, and valuable to the target customers. There is value to learn from competitors. Conditions to be specified in the contest, execution methods, and recipients of the prizes.\n- Sales content. It's important to find out how competitors sell, what key techniques they use to persuade customers to buy.",
  "blog6Subtext2": "After finding competitors, analyzing their content, and borrowing valuable ideas, there's one more crucial step: analyzing account promotion.\nMost Instagram accounts use various advertisements. You need to find out the strategies of competitors that determine the effectiveness of advertising. For example, find out what leads competitors apply, what main requests are used, etc. All this can be found in various services.\nTargeted ads are also a very effective way to promote Instagram pages. It's necessary to observe and identify if competitors are using targeting. Pay attention to what \"tricks\" are being used and how ads are displayed. And you can find all targeted ads on Facebook. Just enter the company name in the search bar.\nHow should competitors' promotional offers be analyzed?\n1. Visual part of ads and text. For analysis, there should be several competitors (e.g., two). Both use modern strategies and graphics but still have different ad styles. However, there is one simple difference in their proposals. The first suggests buying a manual from customers, learning new techniques, and then applying them to make money. The second suggests hiring trainees after training and promises to create a course the next day. The conclusion in this case is: When writing text, don't promise customers more than you actually have.\n2. Goals of targeted ads. Some accounts need many followers, others need engagement, and others need increased sales. It's also worth noting how many different ad layouts are displayed in targeting. If there are several identical ads for the same company, it means they are targeting different potential customers and experimenting.\n3. Authority over followers. Most stores and brands regularly collaborate with several bloggers who purchase ads and cooperate. The opinions of these bloggers are exactly the same as those respected by followers. Therefore, their ads will be more effective for the company.",

All social network users first pay attention to the visual elements of the page and then explore the essence. Therefore, to attract subscribers, you need to know how to beautifully design your account.\nEvery blog has conditional requirements.\n1. Additional information. Users search for bloggers or stores by searching Instagram by name. The profile theme should already be clear at a glance. In the case of a store, posts should include prices and product features. For subscribers, contact information for orders should also be available.\n2. Profile aesthetics. The entire page (from the main photo to the story design) should be in the same style.

At the same time, subscribers should be able to easily remember it.\nFor personal blogs, include your name, surname, or nickname. For stores or brands, include the company name itself.\nFollow these guidelines to make it easy for Instagram users to find your page in searches.\n- Minimum number of characters and numbers in the nickname (preferably none)\n- Do not use too many characters. Otherwise, users may easily make mistakes when searching.\n- Do not write multiple vowels consecutively in the nickname.\n- Do not use the starting part of the nickname the same as competitors. Otherwise, subscribers may mistakenly see the wrong page when searching.\nAccount header. When you open an Instagram page, the first thing that catches your eye is the profile header. It includes a profile picture, profile name, and blog description. All relevant information about the account should be displayed here.\nNo one would want to subscribe to a blog that they don't understand what it's about from the profile header.\n- The main photo should be clear, memorable, and vivid. Bloggers running personal blogs should display their photo in a sharp avatar where their face is clearly visible. Companies and brands should display their own logo in the avatar. In stores, product photos or relevant information should be displayed.\n- Do not use dark and low-quality photos; small, difficult-to-read text; color palettes similar to the background color; photos taken from the internet.\n- The profile name is either the individual's name or the name of the store/company. All users of this social network can find the necessary account not only by the correct nickname but also by the profile name. Therefore, you can write a brief description of the page. For example, a cake shop's name may include 'cakes available for order'.\n- The main information on Instagram is called 'my introduction.' Here, the page owner has the opportunity to explain all important information, but it should be described concisely. Only 150 characters are allocated for this in website management.\nIt's best to include only the following key points.",
  "blog7Subtext2": "This feature is recommended for all Instagram accounts.\nIt is beneficial for stores as it allows buyers to see all important information quickly without losing it. For example, you can enter prices, product features, ordering methods, customer reviews, etc.\nTimeless stories about personal blogs provide subscribers with the opportunity to revisit interesting facts about you. For example, save interesting moments, funny situations, useful information for target customers during your travels.\nEach group of timeless stories should be composed into a beautiful picture that visually matches the entire page.",

If there is text in the picture, the font and size of the text should be the same.\nThe stories should also match the color scheme of the entire profile. For example, if the page is designed in calm, bed-like colors, bright red-shaded stories will look absurd and unattractive.\nTo avoid major mistakes in profile design, prepare a draft, write down all the necessary items for profile design, and fill in the account name, description, etc.\nThere are many feed styling apps that help preview future posts. You can easily learn how to combine color palettes using them.\nDo not be afraid of changes. If you feel that the profile is incomplete or needs adjustment, you can change the design.

However, Instagram users can only edit the photos of their posts; there are no text editing tools. But that doesn't mean you can arrange text however you like. Ultimately, text with paragraphs, lists, titles and subtitles, and structure makes reading much more enjoyable for everyone. To design the text of a post minimally, all you need are 'blank lines,' a few special characters, and the basics of text.",

  "blog8Subtitle3": "Headings and Enumerations",
  "blog8Subtext1": "Firstly, text must be divided into paragraphs. A continuous and monotonous set of words is not engaging to read. Each paragraph reveals one idea. On mobile devices, it's best if each paragraph doesn't exceed 9 lines; otherwise, grasping long thoughts becomes too complicated. Paragraphs in Instagram posts are typically separated by blank lines. Otherwise, subscribers may see a block of text and may not read it. Some bloggers use special symbols, emojis, to separate them.",
  "blog8Subtext2": "Many people already know that Instagram often ignores blank lines and combines text. So, if you enter text on your phone using the 'Enter' key instead of inserting blank lines, Instagram is more likely to display the text without blank lines. What should you do in such a case? As mentioned above, you can use special characters or emojis. You can also insert 'invisible' characters, easily found in any browser. Search for 'invisible characters' in the search bar, copy, and insert them into the necessary parts of the text. When reading other bloggers' posts, you'll notice that most bloggers don't differentiate their text with subtitles. In fact, this isn't the most popular idea on Instagram. However, combining multiple paragraphs with a single idea of the overall text would make it easier and more interesting to read. For example, you can divide the entire text into main sections and enter the subtitle 'Price,' displaying various price ranges of products accordingly. It's customary to indent two lines after the main title and one line after the subtitle when typing on a computer. This isn't possible on Instagram, so you can simply use special characters.",
  "blog8Subtext3": "Since Instagram doesn't have a text editor, you generally can't insert lists like you would in 'Word.' However, avoiding repetition and making text more appealing and readable often involves list-format enumeration. Here's how to go beyond the norm: - Emphasize parts of the list with dashes, emojis, or asterisks. - If parts of the list are short sentences, you can simply separate them with 'blank lines.' - Specify keywords in the body and start enumerating after the colon. Generally, the most important word or phrase in the text is highlighted so that followers don't need to reread the entire text to find the main point. How do you emphasize? - Write words or phrases in separate paragraphs. - Capitalize all letters. - Bold the respective word or phrase. - Write the text backward. - Underline the phrase. - Decorate the phrase with special symbols or emojis. Of course, you shouldn't always apply the same method to all posts. To apply some highlighting methods, you need to use special apps for text editing.",
